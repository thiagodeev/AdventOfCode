Wanna run the challenges?
Just go to the "year" folder and run the `./start.sh` script inside it passing one or two arguments: the folder name and/or file name.  
Ex:  
``` bash
./start.sh 1 //only folder name 
./start.sh 1 part-one.js //folder and file name
```  
<br><br><br>

Ps: are you getting `node: command not found`? Try run `node --version` first in the same terminal window and then run the script again.
